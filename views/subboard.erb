<h1>Caveats</h1>
<ul style="color:#555555">
	<li>It is a demo system which is meant to show how current state of LODQA works for a given query.</li>
	<li>The current interface is designed for developers, not for end users.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>It will show all the intermediate results including parsing results, lexical mappings, and automatically generated SPARQL queries.</li>
		<li>The automatically generated SPARQL queries will get only <u>10 results</u> at most.<br/>See the last part of each query (<i>LIMIT 10</i>).</li>
		<li>To get the full results, the query without the LIMIT modifier has be to excuted, which however will be implemented in the upcoming interface for end users.</li>
